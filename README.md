# Classic Quickbar

a fork of Silverfeelin's [standalone version of the Quickbar](https://github.com/Silverfeelin/Starbound-Quickbar-Mini) from zetaPRIME's [StardustLib](https://github.com/zetaPRIME/sb.StardustSuite) mod

restores the original (non-metagui) Quickbar while supporting newer versions & features of Stardust Core (lite)

### Requires at least one of the following mods:
  - [StardustCoreLite or StardustCore](https://github.com/zetaPRIME/sb.StardustSuite) (recommended)
  - [Quickbar Mini](https://github.com/Silverfeelin/Starbound-Quickbar-Mini) (can't open metaGUI panes)
  - [Community Framework](https://github.com/Emmaker/CommunityFramework) (can't open metaGUI panes unless StardustCore is also isntalled)

## features :
- The original quickbar !
- Can open MetaGUI windows (if StardustCore is installed)
- More conditions
- Togglable compact mode
- Icons can be hidden
- The text wrapping no longer sucks
- Can be opened with a keybind (requires StarExtensions or OpenStarbound)
- the entire mod can be disabled if you want to do that for some reason
