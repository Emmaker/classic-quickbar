## Disclaimer
This repository consists mostly of source files from [zetaPRIME](https://github.com/zetaPRIME)'s [sb.StardustSuite](https://github.com/zetaPRIME/sb.StardustSuite) mod.

The mod takes just the Quickbar from StardustLib, so users can install it without any other tools and features.  
This also makes the Quickbar fully multiplayer compatible, as long as servers allow asset mismatching.

Permission for the creation and distribution of this standalone version was given by zetaPRIME directly.
For licensing information, please refer to the [sb.StardustSuite](https://github.com/zetaPRIME/sb.StardustSuite) repository.
